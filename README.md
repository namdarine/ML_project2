# Project 2

## Model Selection

Implement generic k-fold cross-validation and bootstrapping model selection methods.

In your README, answer the following questions:

** Do your cross-validation and bootstrapping model selectors agree with a simpler model selector like AIC in simple cases (like linear regression)?**
  - Yes. $R^2$ of Ridge Regression is 0.92 and mean $R^2$ of our cross-validation is 0.79 and bootstrapping model is 0.81.
 
** In what cases might the methods you've written fail or give incorrect or undesirable results?**
  - 

** What could you implement given more time to mitigate these cases or help users of your methods?**
  -

** What parameters have you exposed to your users in order to use your model selectors.**
  - 

See sections 7.10-7.11 of Elements of Statistical Learning and the lecture notes. Pay particular attention to Section 7.10.2.

As usual, above-and-beyond efforts will be considered for bonus points.
